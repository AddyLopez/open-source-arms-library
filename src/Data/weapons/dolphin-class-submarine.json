I found the Howaldtswerke shipyard in Kiel when I went to\ngoogle and searched \"thyssenkrupp\" in the city of Kiel. The company page mentions the merger of\nHowaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft and something else all under thyssenkrupp and the wikipedia shows that\nHowaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft has a marine yard in Kiel. So multiple fingers all point at this building boat stuff.\n",
